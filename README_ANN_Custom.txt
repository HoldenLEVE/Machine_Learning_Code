**************************************
Customizable Artificial Neural Network
  Feed-Forward and Back-Propagation
**************************************
The artificial neural network:
	- 1 Input layer
	- 1 Hidden layer
	- 1 Output layer

Upon runtime, the user will choose how many input neurons 
and how many hidden neurons the network will have. 
All weights will be randomly generated.
There is only 1 output neuron. 

The network will go through feed-forward and back-propagation 300
times to show that it is learning to recognize the pattern given.
For simplicity sake, the network will only recognize 1 pattern 
at a time.
